programming constructs are common building blocks used to build a program
1. Sequence
    order in which statements occur and are processed e.g. inside curly braces statements one after the other
    form a sequence
2. Decision / Selection
    a path a program takes during its execution -> if-else and switch statement control this
3. Iteration / Repitition
    repeated execution of a section of code when a program is running 
    for loop: (definite iteration)
    while loop or do-while loop: (indefinite iteration)
    1.   ‘For’ loops should be used when we know the number of iterations beforehand.
    2.   While loop should be used when we know the terminating condition of the loop.
    3.   The do-while loop should be used when we want the loop to be executed at least once.
