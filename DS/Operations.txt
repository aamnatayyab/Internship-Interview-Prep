Searching: This operation is performed to search for a particular element or a key. 
The most common searching algorithms are 
    1. sequential/linear search - linear DS
    2. binary search. - "divide and conquer technique"

Sorting: Sorting operation involves arranging the elements in a data structure in a particular order either ascending or descending. 
There are various sorting algorithms that are available for data structures. Most popular among them are Quicksort, Selection sort, 
Merge sort, etc.

Insertion: Insertion operation deals with adding an element to the data structure. This is the most important operation and as a result
of the addition of an element, the arrangement changes and we need to take care that the data structure remains intact.

Deletion: Deletion operation removes an element from the data structure. The same conditions that are to be considered for insertion 
are to be fulfilled in case of the deletion operation as well.

Traversing: We say that we traverse a data structure when we visit each and every element in the structure. 
Traversing is required to carry out certain specific operations on the data structure.
